To compile and run the C code with OpenMP directives in Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:

Install the OpenMP compiler:

If you have not already installed it, you can install the OpenMP compiler for C by running the following command in the terminal:

csharp
Copy code
sudo apt-get install gcc
Save the C code to a file:

Save the C code that includes the OpenMP directives to a file with a .c extension, for example openmp_example.c.

Compile the C code:

To compile the C code with OpenMP support, you need to add the -fopenmp flag to the gcc command. Run the following command in the terminal:

Copy code
gcc -fopenmp openmp_example.c -o openmp_example
This will create an executable file called openmp_example.

Run the executable:

To run the executable file, simply run the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
./openmp_example
This will run the program and output the results to the terminal. Note that the number of threads used by the program can be controlled through the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable, which you can set before running the program. For example, to use 4 threads, you can run the following command:

bash
Copy code
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./openmp_example
